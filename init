# The different directory locations could either be symlinks pointing
# to locations inside the dot directory.

# Or they could be actual file trees, when this is the first install.

# To ensure we don't mistakenly delete the file trees inside the dot
# directory, we first treat the target locations as symlinks and
# remove them with the simple `rm` command.

# At this point we are sure that if anythoing remains, it is the original
# file tree, so we can safely remove it with `rm -R`.
